# Time Keeper: Tracking Your Digital Hours

## The Idea

**Time Keeper** is a straightforward **time tracking application built for Windows**. Its core purpose is to monitor and record the time spent on each program running on your system.

## The Process

I developed **Time Keeper** as my final project for **CS50-2022**. This project was a significant learning curve for me, as I was still a beginner and had to **learn C# from scratch**. For data storage, I opted to use a **CSV file as a simple database**, providing a practical solution for persistence without the complexity of a full-fledged database system.
