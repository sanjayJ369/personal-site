# LangApp: Effortless Flashcards from Real-World Language

## Overview

**LangApp** is a powerful command-line tool that automates flashcard creation for language learners. Feed it foreign-language text, and it will extract unknown words and pair them with precise definitions—ready for Anki import. Perfect for learners who want to grow their vocabulary from authentic sources.

---

## How It Works

LangApp is built with robust Go code and follows a straightforward workflow:

1. **Parse a Dictionary**  
   Import a large multilingual JSONL dictionary (e.g., from `kaikki.org`) and build a local, persistent word-meaning database.

2. **Generate Flashcards**  
   Provide any text—LangApp identifies unfamiliar words, finds their definitions, and outputs Anki-compatible cards in `cards.txt`.

3. **Optimized Performance**
   - Efficient, multi-threaded parsing (`-t 10`).
   - CLI flags for control and feedback (`-p true` for progress).
   - All data is stored locally for speed and offline access.

## Example Workflow

**1. Parse a Dictionary:**

```sh
go run cmd/parser/main.go -db ./assets/meaning/ -dict ./assets/kaikki.org-dictionary-English.jsonl -t 10 -p true
```

## Why Use LangApp?

- **Instant Vocabulary**: Transform any authentic text into custom flashcards—no manual entry.
- **Anki Compatible**: Output is ready for direct import into Anki for spaced repetition learning.
- **Open Source & Extensible**: Free to use and customize—contributions welcome!
